# Individual project

For the BST270 individual project you need to reproduce 2 tables/figures from a NYT/FiveThirtyEight article. You have to
write a
“reproducible” workflow detailing what you did, how you did it, why, where the data is… The project
should be shared on GitHub with appropriate documentation.

Send an email to Viola and Raphael by **Monday January 22nd** with the name of the repo.

Check out one of 2023 projects: [Chris Covington](https://github.com/ctcovington/BST_270_project)

## Choice of article

Choose one of the articles from FiveThirtyEight ([https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/))
or the NYT ([https://github.com/nytimes](https://github.com/nytimes)) that:
1. Have public data available
2. Have at least two figures* (two figures/two tables/one table and one figure) shown in the main text

The topic is not relevant, as long as it is something you care about or find interesting.

## Reproduce the figures

### Minimal requirements

- Project in a GitHub repo accessible to teaching team (either public repo or private repo made accessible to Viola and Raphael).
- GitHub repo needs to be have a README file that briefly explains the goal of the project, where to find the files, how
 to proceed to reproduce the results.
- Submit at least one Rmarkdown notebook that knits and that is well documented, with task and goals explained, project structure detailed.
- Project needs to be self-contained and people should be able to reproduce your results by following your instructions/code.
- Code needs to be well commented
- Data correctly stored or referenced (don't forget to check if you can share the data)
- Data preprocessing adequately commented
- **If you are unable to exactly replicate the figures it is OK. Just write down an explaination on why that is the case** 

### Extras

We recommend using a notebook such that you can include comments and show external figures where necessary. However, any
effort is appreciated, as long as we can reproduce it. 
**Apply any trick you learnt during this course or outside**.

As long as we are able to reproduce your figures and tables:
- Python is OK
- Workflow management systems are OK
- Quarto projects are OK
- ...
- 200 C++ functions properly compiling and well documented, with a complete description of the project are OK (but
  please don't do it :) )
