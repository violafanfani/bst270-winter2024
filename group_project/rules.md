# Rules for group project

We are gonna be split in groups. Since the exercise is relatively easy, choose one person per group that is the 'lead'
and is the one who is gonna open the PR. 

Add each feature as a new function that can be called from the main markdown file. This way we are gonna be able to work
together without clashes.

Add comments and documentation for each of your functions. We have created a dummy R package, such that we can see the
behavior of the functions with the roxygen documentation.


## Issues and bugs

If something is missing or something needs fixing, please open an issue, with a detailed description of the
problem/solution. 

If you are fixing one of the open issues, reference is in the commit/PR.
